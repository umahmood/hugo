On Friday the 21st of August I attended the [Golang UK conference 2015](http://www.golanguk.com/) held at
the amazing Brewery in London. This post is a short write up of my time at the
conference.

This was my first ever conference so apart from the talks, I did not know what
else to expect. Overall though, I found the conference was excellent and I met
a wide range of interesting people.

##### Turnout

The turnout was quite big with over 250 delegates from all over the world.

##### Go usage

From the people I met no one was really using Go in a big way, but had an
API or a small server component written in Go. However, everyone was expecting
to increase there Go usage through out the coming year.

##### Talks

The conference consisted of 2 tracks, a main track and a side track. The talks I
went to:

- Opening Keynote
- Crossing the Language Chasm
- Building API's
- Complex Concurrency Patterns in Go
- Code Analysis
- Understanding Memory Allocation
- Whispered Secrets
- The Go Community

Out of all the talks, the best one was Code Analysis presented by Francesc Campoy.

##### Food :)

The food served at the conference was absoutetly amazing. Many of the delgates
said that it was best food of any conference they had been to.

Fin.
